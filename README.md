# restaurant-page

The following project is a simple website for an imaginary restaurant. This project was built to learn and practice webpack and building HTML code out of JS using package bundling. I also practiced more DOM manipulation to simulate tab switching with a nav bar, as well as practiced importing/exporting modules to seperate lengthy code.
